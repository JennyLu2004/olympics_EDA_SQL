# olympics_EDA_SQL
The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results. 
It has Historical Olympic Games data of 120 years (from 1896 to 2016) 

In this project, I utilized my SQL knowledge to explore and derive some interesting facts about the Olympic Games dataset. For example, a few of what I did was: 
- Fetching the top 5 atheletes who have won the most medals (gold/bronze/silver)
- Finding the ratio of male and female athletes participated in all Olympic games
- Finding which year saw the highest and lowest number of countries participating in the Olympics.
- Listing down total gold, silver and broze medals won by each country corresponding to each olympic games.

These are 4 out of the 20 exploratory findings that I did for this project.

This project was my first EDA project using SQL. It had allowed me to apply what I learned into practice. 

My biggest takeaway from it is the importance of CTEs (Common Table Expression). Without them, I would not be able to write complex commands and gain insights into the dataset.
